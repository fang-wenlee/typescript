# typescript
Setting:
1. tsc ==> check to see if typescript installed
2. if no ==>npm install -g typescript
3. tsc --init ==> to create tsconfig.json
4. tsc -w => watch for change and recompile

Objective:
typeScript for OOP
1. TypeScript for properties and constructor
2. TypeScript for Methods
3. Using Get ==> property of the class that has more logic that can be defined
4. Using Set to change property value 

5. Inheritance => extends 
               => Implements : a => class b: interface
               => Super()
               => Super() overrides ==> override parent's method with super
               => Generics => give static typeing to a dynamic type

               => Polymorphism
