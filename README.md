# typescript
Setting:
1. tsc ==> check to see if typescript installed
2. if no ==>npm install -g typescript
3. tsc --init ==> to create tsconfig.json
4. tsc -w => watch for change and recompile

Objective:
typeScript for OOP
1. TypeScript for properties and constructor
2. TypeScript for Methods
3. Using Get ==> property of the class that has more logic that can be defined
4. Using Set to change property value 

5. Inheritance => extends 
               => Implements : a => class b: interface
               => Super()
               => Super() overrides ==> override parent's method with super
               => Generics => give static typeing to a dynamic type

               => Polymorphism: 
                  example: 1: method or param overriding [ super.method()] (child overrides parent method)
                           2: method overloading -> same name metthods
                           3: interface / abstract class implements

6. Encapsulation: [Another aspect of OOP]
     1. Private: only accessible within class
     2. Protected: only accessible within class itself and derived class
         ** there would be issue, when implement the class with shape of parent, it wont' be implemente thing correctly 
         ** because only child class  hss  access the private proter.
        
     3. Public: default

6.1: Static

6.2: readOnly
